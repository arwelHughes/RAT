## Custom Layers Example

This shows an example of using a 'custom layers' model to analyse reflectivity
from a supported bilayer of DSPC. In essence, custom models allow you to parameterise
you model in any way you like, and then use a file to define the final layer structure.

The custom model used here is in 'DSPC_Custom_Bilayer.m', and the example usage is 
in orsoDSPCCUstomLayersWorksheet.mlx
